COVID-19 Detection and Lung & Infection Mask Segmentation Using UNET


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic


Description

A CNN model was trained to detect COVID-19 in CT scans of lung. UNET models have been developed to detect the infected region in the CT scans and to perform lung segmenation as well.

Dataset

COVID-19 CT scans which consists of 20 CT scans and expert segmentations of patients with COVID-19 which is nifti format has been used for training.
